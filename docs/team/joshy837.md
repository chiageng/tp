### Project: PoochPlanner

PoochPlanner is a desktop application to track details of various groups (supplier, maintainer, staff) that dog cafe owners have to regularly interact with. The app is optimised for use using Command Line Interface (CLI) while still encompassing a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature : Search**: Added the ability to search for any contact.
    * What it does: allows the user to search a contact within a field using a specified keyword.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users can find and locate contacts in this address book without having to scroll through the entire list. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature : Sort**: Added the ability to sort contacts in the contacts list.
    * What it does: allows the user to sort contacts in the contacts list by a specific field such name or phone number in ascending order.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users can sort their contacts list in any ordering they prefer without having to restrict themselves to the default ordering.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature : UI**: Revamped the entire user interface.
    * What it does: Made the new GUI more user-friendly with more visible search boxes, rounded corners and better colour scheme.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because with a revamped GUI,  this user-centric design is more tailored specifically for our target audience, the dog cafe owners.
    * Highlights: This enhancement replaces the old UI to favour a new enhanced version to make PoochPlanner more aesthetically pleasing for users.
